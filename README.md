# SCR-Autopilot
A working autopilot (nearly) for the game Stepford Country Railway. You will still need to click "Next Leg" manually, however this can be done easily through the use of an autoclicker.
## How to use
Simply load the script using an executor of your choice, ***AFTER YOU HAVE SPAWNED IN YOUR TRAIN***. After you have started the script, ***DO NOT INTERFERE*** with the driving.
